## Usage Examples

When referring to the [Windows Service Reference Table](#windows-services-reference-table), you can call the name listed under the column `Service Name` and utilize it with commands such as `sc`:

<br />

### Check Service Status

```shell
sc query ServiceName
```

<br />

### Check Service Permissions

```shell
sc sdshow ServiceName
```

<br />

You can use the following to check the permissions for the `Microsoft Passport` service:

```shell
sc sdshow NgcSvc
```

<br />

### Start a Service

```shell
sc start ServiceName
```

<br />

### Stop a Service

```shell
sc stop ServiceName
```

<br />

### Get Service Configuration

```shell
sc qc ServiceName
```

<br />

### Notes

- Service names are case-insensitive when using the `sc` command
- Some services may have additional per-user instances with suffixes like `_xxxxx`
- Third-party software may install additional services not listed here
- Always run service management commands with administrator privileges
- Some protected services may require additional permissions to modify
  - See section [Check Service Permissions](#check-service-permissions-1)

<br />

---

<br />

## Batch Scripts

The following scripts allow you to modify existing service permissions for a user and grant them the ability to manage a service (start, stop, etc).

<br />

### 1. Check Service Permissions (Simple)

```batch
@echo off
set servicename=%1
if "%servicename%"=="" set servicename=ServiceName

echo Checking permissions for service: %servicename%
echo.
echo Security descriptor for %servicename%:
sc sdshow %servicename%

echo.
echo Common SDDL abbreviations:
echo SY = SYSTEM
echo BA = Built-in Administrators
echo AU = Authenticated Users
echo PU = Power Users
echo BU = Built-in Users
echo.
pause
```

<br />

### 2. Check Service Permissions (Advanced with PowerShell)

```batch
@echo off
set servicename=%1
if "%servicename%"=="" set servicename=ServiceName

echo Checking permissions for service: %servicename%

powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "6 {
    $serviceName = '%servicename%'
    $sddl = (sc.exe sdshow $serviceName)[1]
    Write-Host 'Raw SDDL:' $sddl
    Write-Host ''
    if (Get-Command ConvertFrom-SddlString -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) {
        Write-Host 'Decoded permissions:'
        $permissions = ConvertFrom-SddlString -Sddl $sddl
        $permissions.DiscretionaryAcl | Format-Table -AutoSize
    } else {
        Write-Host 'ConvertFrom-SddlString not available. Raw SDDL shown above.'
    }
}"

pause
```

<br />

### 3. Grant Service Permissions (Template)

```batch
@echo off
echo Granting service permissions...

:: Define service and user
set servicename=ServiceName
set username=DOMAIN\Username

:: Get current security descriptor
for /f "tokens=2 delims= " %%a in ('sc sdshow %servicename%') do set currentsd=%%a

:: Grant full control permissions to service
:: Note: Must construct the proper SDDL string
sc sdset %servicename% "D:(A;;CCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRRC;;;SY)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;AU)(A;;CCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRRC;;;PU)(A;;RPWPCRDTLORCSDRCWDWO;;;%username%)"

if %errorlevel% equ 0 (
    echo Permissions granted successfully.
) else (
    echo Failed to grant permissions. Error code: %errorlevel%
)

pause
```

<br />

---

<br />

## SDDL (Security Descriptor Definition Language) Reference

This section explains the format used when modifying permissions for a service, and a list of what each group of permissions means.

<br />

### Structure

An SDDL string has the following format:
```
D:(ace1)(ace2)(ace3)...S:(ace1)(ace2)...
```

- **D:** = Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) - who can access what
- **S:** = System Access Control List (SACL) - auditing information

<br />

### ACE (Access Control Entry) Format

```
(AceType;;Rights;;;SecurityPrincipal)
```

<br />

### AceType

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| A    | Allow access |
| D    | Deny access |
| AU   | Audit (both success and failure) |
| AL   | Audit (success only) |
| AF   | Audit (failure only) |

<br />

### Rights (Service-Specific)

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| CC   | Query Configuration |
| DC   | Change Configuration |
| LC   | Query Status |
| SW   | Enumerate Dependencies |
| RP   | Start Service |
| WP   | Stop Service |
| DT   | Pause/Continue Service |
| LO   | Interrogate Service |
| CR   | User-Defined Control |
| SD   | Delete Service |
| RC   | Read Security Descriptor |
| WD   | Write Security Descriptor |
| WO   | Write Owner |

<br />

### Common Rights Combinations

| Combination | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO | Full Control |
| CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRRC | Read/Execute |
| RPWPCR | Start/Stop Service |

<br />

### Security Principals

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| SY   | Local System |
| BA   | Built-in Administrators |
| AU   | Authenticated Users |
| PU   | Power Users |
| BU   | Built-in Users |
| WD   | Everyone |
| AN   | Anonymous |
| IU   | Interactive Users |
| NU   | Network Users |
| S-1-5-... | Specific user/group SID |

<br />

### Example SDDL Breakdown

```
